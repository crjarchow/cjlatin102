C. Translationhe wanted
When Hercules had come to the hospitality of King Dexamenus and had deflowered his daughter Deianira, he wanted to lead her as his wife. When Hercules was away, a centaur Eurytion sought Deianira as a wife. Since her father was afraid of the centaur, he promised her to him. On a certain day, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules found out and killed the centaur, and led Deianira away.

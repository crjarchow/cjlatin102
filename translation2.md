William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin. 
  Ut depono moriens
C. Translation
  Deianira, the wide of Hercules, was not able to cross the large river, to which Evenus was the name, and she asked the help of Nessus the Centaur who was the son of Luxoris and Nubis. The centaur wished to rape Deianira who had lifted up in the river itself. To this place, Hercules fastened Nessus with arrows when he might have intervened and when Deianira might have implored the protection of him. That dying centaur gave his own blood to Deianira who was saved and that this is the potion when he knew that the large arrows which were soaked with the poison of the Hydra Lernae to have potency.

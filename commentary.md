Option B
Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

A statue of young Herculues at the Capitoline Museum, Inv. Scu. 247	draws similarities to Hyginus, Chapter 30, section 1. Two similarities between Hyginus' Latin and the statue is that both illustrates an infant and the infant killing the snake with his hands. It is difficult to tell if there is another snake besides the infant, but it does show the infant and the infant is killing the snake with his hands.
